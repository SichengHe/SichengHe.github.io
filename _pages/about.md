My name is Sicheng He. 
I am a postdoc research associate at the Unversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor collaborating with [Prof. Joaquim R. R. A. Martins](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/martins-joaquim-r-r-a/).
Currently, I am developing algorithms to enable large-scale optimization of dynamical systems with high-fidelity models.

My research interests include:

* Optimization 
  * PDE-constraind optimization 
  * Mixed integer programming 
  * Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) 
  * Control co-design (CCD)
  * Machine learning based surrogate mode 
* Sensitivity analysis 
  * Adjoint method 
  * Algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* High performance computing (HPC) 
  * Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
  * Computational aeroelasticity
* Theoretical fluid dynamics
  * Laminar turbulent transitional flow 
  * Transonic buffet

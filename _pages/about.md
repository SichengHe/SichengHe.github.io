My name is Sicheng He. I am currently a postdoct research associate at the Unversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor collaborating with [Prof. Joaquim R. R. A. Martins](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/martins-joaquim-r-r-a/).

My research interests include

* Optimization (PDE-constraind optimization / numerical optimization / mixed integer programming / multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) / Control co-design)
* Sensitivity analysis (adjoint method / algorithmic differentiation (AD))
* High performance computing (HPC) for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational aeroelasticity
* Deep learning
* Theoretical fluid dynamics (laminar turbulent transitional flow / buffet)

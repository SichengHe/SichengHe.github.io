My name is Sicheng He. 
I am a PostDoc at the [LAE lab](https://lae.mit.edu/) at MIT working with [Prof. Barrett](http://barrett.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Speth](https://lae.mit.edu/team/raymond-speth/).
Previously, I worked with [Prof. Joaquim R. R. A. Martins](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/martins-joaquim-r-r-a/) as a Ph.D. student and later as a PostDoc research associate at the Unversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor.
In Michigan, I developed algorithms to enable large-scale optimization of dynamical systems with high-fidelity models.


My research interests include:

* Optimization 
  * PDE-constraind optimization 
  * Mixed integer programming 
  * Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) 
  * Control co-design (CCD)
  * Machine learning based surrogate mode 
* Sensitivity analysis 
  * Adjoint method 
  * Algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* High performance computing (HPC) 
  * Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
  * Computational aeroelasticity
* Theoretical fluid dynamics
  * Laminar turbulent transitional flow 
  * Transonic buffet

My name is Sicheng He. 
I am a PostDoc at the [LAE lab](https://lae.mit.edu/) at MIT working with [Prof. Barrett](http://barrett.mit.edu/) and [Dr. Speth](https://lae.mit.edu/team/raymond-speth/).
Previously, I worked with [Prof. Joaquim R. R. A. Martins](https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/martins-joaquim-r-r-a/) at the Unversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor.

My research is driven by the critical applications required by the industry and the goverment.
I am passionate about math and programming.
In my research, I use mathematical tools to convert previous untackled problem into a formulation that can be solved efficiently and I develop programs to solve the problems in large scale.
The potential impact areas of my research include aerospace, wind energy, robotics, and automobile industries.
My previous research was funded by AFOSR, ARPA-e, and FAA.
An overview of my research is shown below:

My research vision that differentiates me from other labs doing MDO is listed below:
1. **(Theory)** MDO shall be enabled to address ever **more complex dynamical systems and control problems** beyond the current focus, i.e., the steady-state problems.
2. **(Implementation / code)** **Efficient and general-purpose codes** for design optimization in dynamical system and control shall be developed leveraging the abstraction ability of the mathematical representation.
3. **(Application)** I develop **enviromentally friendly engineering designs**, such as efficient off-shore wind turbine, and aircraft with less noise and emission, to address critical climate and energy challenges of the modern society.


My research interests include:

* Optimization 
  * PDE-constraind optimization 
  * Mixed integer programming 
  * Multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) 
  * Control co-design (CCD)
  * Machine learning based surrogate mode 
* Sensitivity analysis 
  * Adjoint method 
  * Algorithmic differentiation (AD)
* High performance computing (HPC) 
  * Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) 
  * Computational aeroelasticity
* Theoretical fluid dynamics
  * Laminar turbulent transitional flow 
  * Transonic buffet
